# AirCanvas-Virtual-Drawing-Using-Hand-Gestures-
Created a real-time virtual canvas application that allows users to draw in the air using hand gestures and color 
detection with OpenCV. 
● Gesture Detection: Tracked fingertip movements using color-based contour detection. 
● Real-Time Drawing: Implemented drawing tools for selecting colors and erasing in real-time on screen. 
● User Interface: Enabled user-friendly control over colors, and canvas clearing.
